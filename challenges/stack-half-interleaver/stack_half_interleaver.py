#Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.
#Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.
#For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].
